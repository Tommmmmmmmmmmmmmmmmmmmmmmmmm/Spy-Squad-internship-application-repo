# Spy Squd internship application repository

For SpringBehaviourHandler, I recommend looking at SpringBehaviourHandler first (which is a lot easier to look through in an IDE than the github file viewer), then either of the two child scripts.

For my collection of UnityEvent composition scripts, I recommend skimming over the Triggerers folder first, then either of the other two.

And as for yarn, you'd of course need to play the game to really get a feel for it, but I've also provided the option of watching a clip of a steamer play it.
