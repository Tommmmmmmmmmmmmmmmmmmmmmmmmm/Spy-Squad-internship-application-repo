###Most complex script or small collection of scripts - SpringBehaviourHandler (and child scripts)

For SpringBehaviourHandler, I reccomend looking at SpringBehaviourHandler first, then either of the two child scripts.

For my collection of UnityEvent composition scripts, I reccomend skimming over the Triggerers folder first, then either of the other two.

As for yarn, you'd of course need to play the game to really get a feel for it, but there's also the option of watching my clip of a steamer play it.
